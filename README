Condor Low Latency Scheduling (CL2S)
Database-based system to execute Condor jobs on a cluster (assumed to be 
homogeneous) bypassing all match-making negotiations. Makes use of Condor job 
hooks which run on the compute nodes and fetch jobs directly from a queue. The
queue can be anything but it is likely to be a database of some sort.
